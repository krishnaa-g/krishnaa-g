		<br>
		<p>First of all, Merry Christmas! I hope you are having a nice time at Prayagraj.</p>
		<p>I'm honestly admitting that I'm no good at trying to be creative or innovative whatsoever, so I'm going to stick to the basic and the best form of communication : Open Talk. I have written the following message from the bottom of my heart, and I wish I succeed in what I want to convey. I really hope that at the end, this message creates a positive and wholesome impact, as I'm trying to make a open and heartly conversation with you.</p>
		<p>I still remember the day, when I came with you nd Vishal Ram to Abirami Xerox, since Vishal had wanted to take a copy of something. Initially, I used to confuse your name with Vishal's, I even addressed you as Vishal, if you remember.</p>
		<p>I also clearly remember the fine Wednesday evening, when we were sitting in the open hall in the library where you and Adithya were helping me to complete my week 3 German assignment by providinfg me the solutions. At that exact moment, I thought we would make good friends.</p>
		<p>And then, on one fine evening while we were walking down the CTV-TIFAC road, I asked you something which, after a few days of the happening of that incident, I realised that I shouldn't have asked.  The intention of asking you that question was purely a bait to make a conversation, but then I could have started off with a lighter-note. I feel like I myself killed the slowly developing friendship between us.</p>
		<p>I really wanted to come to you and apologise for what happened. But after a lot of internal thought-process, I arrived at a conclusion that talking about it once again might make things much more worse. So I tried to move on, trying to forget the blunder I made.</p>
		<p>My hopes were that, maybe if we kept continuing to attend ELS sessions regularly, we would start making some pep talk and hence pick up momentum from there on. Unfortunately, I couldn't attend many ELS sessions as I wanted to, since it would be cost me more money and time to stay at campus till 7.30 in the night and reach home by 9. For this reason, I was being verty selective in deciding which ELS sessions to attend to which not to. As it turned out, you and I complimented each other in attending the sessions. You were there at club when I wasn't and vice-versa. Ultimately, this reduced the spatial and temporal probability of us meeting and having a talk.</p>
		<p>Fast forward a few months, freshers orientation took place. As we were all planning for the introductory session, we got the opportunity to talk. The generous and kind heart of yours wanted to restore peace and freindship between us. You made an offer which I couldn't refuse. You might not believe it, but on that particular night, I really cried. I cried out of happiness that I made a good friend. I cried out of remorse and regret because, at last, it was you, and not me, who came down from the hill to make peace. I felt shameful and guilty, as shame and guilt were taking over me that day. Took me one full night to get back to normal.</p>
		<p> I take this message as an opportunity to convey my apologies for what I did on the other day. I really hope that we could now stay friends. I'm really glad that I've got an excellent friend in Srinath.</p>

		<h3>Looking forward for better days ahead!</h3>
